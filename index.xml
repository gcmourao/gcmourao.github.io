      <description>Rmarkdown is a super useful package in R! It enables the creation of reports in different formats like word, pdf, html, and others; all of them very neat and professional. I also like to use it in small projects, since it is possible to comment all steps in a very organized way, besides that you can even develop your own theme and the results are awesome!
I decided to make this tutorial to help those who are new to Rmarkdown, making it very straightforward to the features that I use most, so one can start using all the awesome options of this package that makes our lives much easier right away!</description>
