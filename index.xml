      <description>I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte/Brazil. Since the very beginning of the course I got passionate about Statistical Modeling after taking some Econometric courses. After that, I decided to deepen my knowledge attending some additional courses like Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations in the University’s Statistics department.
After my graduation, I had the opportunity to live in the biggest cities in Brazil: Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.</description>

      <description>Rmarkdown is a super useful package in R! It enables the creation of reports in different formats like word, pdf, html, and others; all of them very neat and professional. I also like to use it in small projects, since it is possible to comment all steps in a very organized way, besides that you can even develop your own theme and the results are awesome!
I decided to make this tutorial to help those who are new to Rmarkdown, making it very straightforward to the features that I use most, so one can start using all the awesome options of this package that makes our lives much easier right away!</description>
