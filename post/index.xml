      <description>This article was developed based on the final project for a Social Media Analytics Course in the University of Hong Kongâ€™s Master of Science in Business Analytics programme. The project is a result of a team effort and everybody worked hard to deliver all analysis that are going to be presented in this document. I would like to say thank you to all my team mates: August Hjorth, Maria Raquel Gomez Lopez, Martina de Luca, Xiaoyen Chen and Mawuli Adjei.</description>

      <description>Rmarkdown is a super useful package in R! It enables the creation of reports in different formats like word, pdf, html, and others; all of them very neat and professional. I also like to use it in small projects, since it is possible to comment all steps in a very organized way, besides that you can even develop your own theme and the results are awesome!
I decided to make this tutorial to help those who are new to Rmarkdown, making it very straightforward to the features that I use most, so one can start using all the awesome options of this package that makes our lives much easier right away!</description>
