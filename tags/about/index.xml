      <description>I was graduated from the University of Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte/ Brazil) in 2010 with a bachelor degree in Economics. Since the very beginning of the course I got passionate about Statistical Modeling after taking some Econometric courses. After that, I decided to deepen my knowledge attending some additional courses like Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations in the Universityâ€™s Statistics department.
After my graduation, I had the opportunity to live in the biggest cities in Brazil: Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.</description>
